## Custom Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Classification

This repository contains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch for the classification of the MNIST dataset.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TorchVision
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

### Files

1. `train_custom_net.py`: This script trains the custom CNN on the MNIST dataset and saves the trained model after each epoch. It also logs the training loss and learning rate using TensorBoard.
2. `my_conv_nn.py`: This file defines the architecture of the custom CNN.
3. `model_inference.py`: This script allows you to perform inference on a single image using the trained model. It loads an image, preprocesses it, and uses the trained model to predict the digit and its probability.
4. `models/`: This folder will contain the trained model files saved after each epoch during the training process.
5. `runs/`: This folder will store the logs generated by TensorBoard during the training process.
6. `data/`: This folder will be used to store the MNIST dataset.

### Usage

1. Install the required libraries mentioned in the `Requirements` section.
2. Download the MNIST dataset using the script, or make sure you have the dataset available in the `data` directory.
3. Run the `train_custom_net.py` script to start the training process:

```bash
python train_custom_net.py
```

4. During training, the script will log the training loss and learning rate using TensorBoard. You can visualize the training progress by running TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs/custom_net_mnist
```

5. The trained model will be saved in the `models` directory after each epoch.

6. To perform inference on a single image using the trained model, run the `model_inference.py` script and provide the path to the image you want to classify:

```bash
python model_inference.py
```

### Notes

- The custom CNN architecture is defined in `my_conv_nn.py`. You can modify this file to experiment with different CNN architectures.
- The hyperparameters such as `BATCH_SIZE`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `NUM_OF_EPOCHS`, and `ITERATION_LOGGING_FREQUENCY` can be adjusted in `train_custom_net.py` as needed.
- The code assumes that you have a GPU available for training (`'cuda'`). If not, it will use the CPU (`'cpu'`) for training and inference.
- The custom CNN is designed to classify the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of hand-written digits (0-9).
